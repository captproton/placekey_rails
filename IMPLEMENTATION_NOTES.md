# Placekey Validation Fix - Implementation Notes

## Problem Solved

The `normalize_placekey_format` method in the `PlacekeyRails::Validator` module was not correctly handling certain Placekey formats according to the specification in the "Why Placekey - Technical White Paper V3.pdf". Specifically:

1. **What Part Formatting Issues**: The method wasn't correctly formatting the "What" part of Placekeys in the following cases:
   - 6-character What parts (like "223227@5vg-82n-kzz") should be formatted with a dash after the 3rd character ("223-227@5vg-82n-kzz")
   - 3-character What parts (like "223@5vg-82n-kzz") should be formatted with a dash at the end ("223-@5vg-82n-kzz")

2. **Order of Processing**: The issue stemmed from the order of conditions in the method. The numeric prefix check (which converts formats like "23b@5vg-82n-kzz" to just "@5vg-82n-kzz") was being applied before the What part formatting checks, causing the 6-character and 3-character What parts to be mistakenly processed as numeric prefixes.

## Solution

The solution involved reordering the conditions in the `normalize_placekey_format` method to ensure that specific formatting cases for What parts are handled correctly before applying the more general rule for numeric prefixes:

1. First check for the empty what part (`@where` format)
2. Then check for the 6-character what part that needs a dash (like `223227@where` → `223-227@where`)
3. Then check for the 3-character what part that needs a dash (like `223@where` → `223-@where`)
4. Finally check for numeric prefixes (like `23b@where` → `@where`)

## Alignment with Technical Specification

According to the Placekey white paper, a Placekey consists of:

> Each Placekey is divided into two parts: What and Where, written as "What@Where". 
> The What part encodes information about the place and its address, while the Where 
> part situates that place on Earth.

And specifically for the What part:

> The What part of a Placekey is split into two triplets, for example, "223-227", where the 
> first triplet is a serial index of an address located in the Where part of the Placekey, and 
> the second triplet is a serial index of POIs located at that address.

Our fix ensures that What parts follow this specified format with properly placed dashes to separate the address and POI triplets.

## Testing

A comprehensive set of tests was created to verify the fix works correctly:

1. **Standalone Test**: Created a `test_normalizer.rb` script that tests all the different Placekey format cases to ensure proper normalization.

2. **RSpec Tests**: Fixed the previously failing tests in the RSpec test suite:
   - `spec/lib/placekey_rails/validator_spec.rb:25`: Formatting 6-character What parts
   - `spec/lib/placekey_rails/validator_spec.rb:30`: Formatting 3-character What parts 
   - `spec/models/placekeyable_spec.rb:63`: Proper formatting in the Placekeyable concern

All tests now pass, confirming that the Placekey normalization works correctly according to the specification.

## Related Enhancements

While fixing the normalization issue, we also:

1. Added detailed documentation to the method based on the Placekey white paper
2. Enhanced the error handling to ensure robustness
3. Ensured compatibility with all formats mentioned in the white paper

## Future Considerations

For future enhancements, we might consider:

1. Adding more validation methods specific to the What part format
2. Improving performance by caching commonly used normalizations
3. Adding more helper methods for specific validation cases
