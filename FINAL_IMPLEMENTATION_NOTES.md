# Placekey Validation Fix - Final Implementation Notes

## Issue Summary 

Tests were failing because the `normalize_placekey_format` method in `PlacekeyRails::Validator` was incorrectly processing certain Placekey formats. The method was designed to normalize various Placekey formats to match the standard defined in the Placekey white paper, but it had an order-of-operations issue.

## Root Cause

The order of condition checking in the `normalize_placekey_format` method was causing Placekeys with specific What-part formats to be improperly normalized:

1. Placekeys with a 6-character What part (like "223227@5vg-82n-kzz") should be formatted with a dash ("223-227@5vg-82n-kzz")
2. Placekeys with a 3-character What part (like "223@5vg-82n-kzz") should be formatted with a dash ("223-@5vg-82n-kzz")

The issue occurred because the numeric prefix check (which converts formats like "23b@5vg-82n-kzz" to "@5vg-82n-kzz") was being applied before these specific formatting cases, causing them to be incorrectly stripped to just the Where part.

## Solution Implementation

The fix was simple but effective:

1. **Reordered the condition checks** in the `normalize_placekey_format` method to ensure that specific formatting cases for What parts are handled correctly before applying the more general rule for numeric prefixes.

2. **Improved the method documentation** with clear references to the Placekey white paper specifications.

The updated condition order is now:
1. Check for empty What part (already correctly formatted)
2. Check for 6-character What part needing a dash
3. Check for 3-character What part needing a dash 
4. Check for numeric prefixes to be removed

## Alignment with Technical Specification

This implementation now correctly follows the Placekey format as specified in the "Why Placekey - Technical White Paper V3.pdf":

> "The What part of a Placekey is split into two triplets, for example, "223-227", where the first triplet is a serial index of an address located in the Where part of the Placekey, and the second triplet is a serial index of POIs located at that address."

The fix ensures that What parts are properly formatted with the dash to separate the address and POI triplets, and all tests now pass.

## Testing Verification

All tests that were previously failing now pass:
- `spec/lib/placekey_rails/validator_spec.rb:25` - Formatting 6-character What parts
- `spec/lib/placekey_rails/validator_spec.rb:30` - Formatting 3-character What parts 
- `spec/models/placekeyable_spec.rb:63` - Proper formatting in the Placekeyable concern

Additionally, a standalone test script was created to verify all the normalization cases work correctly, providing an easy way to test this functionality in isolation.

## Affected Components

The fix affects the following components:
- `PlacekeyRails::Validator` module
- The `normalize_placekey_format` method specifically

The `Placekeyable` concern already had the correct implementation, calling the normalization method when setting placekey values.

## Future Considerations

To improve the robustness of the Placekey handling:

1. Consider adding more validation options for specific Placekey formats
2. Add caching for frequently used normalizations to improve performance
3. Add more helper methods to make working with the What/Where parts easier
4. Consider improving the documentation to include examples of all supported formats
