# PlacekeyRails Development Status

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the current development status of PlacekeyRails.

## Core Components Status

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Converter | ✅ Stable | Core conversion functionality works as expected |
| Validator | ✅ Stable | Validation functionality verified and working |
| Spatial | ✅ Stable | Spatial operations functionality working correctly |
| Client | ✅ Mostly Stable | API client functionality working; some edge cases may need handling |
| Batch Processing | ⚠️ Needs Fixes | Parameter handling inconsistencies and test failures |
| Form Helpers | ⚠️ Needs Fixes | Issues with field options handling |
| Placekeyable Concern | ⚠️ Needs Fixes | Issues with respond_to? method in some contexts |
| API Controllers | ⚠️ Needs Testing | Implementation complete but needs more thorough testing |

## Known Issues

1. **Placekeyable Concern**
   - The `respond_to?` method implementation doesn't properly handle the optional second parameter
   - The `distance_to` method has issues with parameter handling

2. **BatchProcessor**
   - Inconsistent parameter handling between implementation and tests
   - The `geocode` method doesn't match test expectations

3. **FormHelper**
   - Field options handling doesn't properly match test expectations
   - Parameter handling needs to be standardized

4. **General**
   - Inconsistent approach to parameter handling (keyword args vs. options hash)
   - Some components lacking comprehensive test coverage
   - Error handling could be improved in several components

## Roadmap

### Short-term (within 2 weeks)
- Fix all failing tests
- Standardize parameter handling across components
- Improve error handling and reporting
- Update documentation to match implementation

### Medium-term (1-2 months)
- Add more comprehensive test coverage
- Improve performance for large datasets
- Enhance caching strategies
- Create detailed usage examples

### Long-term (3+ months)
- Add support for additional data formats
- Create visualization components
- Implement more sophisticated spatial analysis tools
- Add background job support for large data processing
